# Deep Learning Foundation Using PyTorch and PyTorch Lightning  

## Project Overview  

This project explores deep learning concepts and implements them using **PyTorch** and **PyTorch Lightning**. The notebook provides a structured workflow for building and training neural networks, focusing on modular and efficient code.  

### Contents of the Project:  

1. **Data Handling**:  
   - Loading and preprocessing datasets for training and validation.  
   - Implementation of custom datasets and data loaders using PyTorch.  

2. **Model Architecture**:  
   - Definition of neural network models with PyTorch.  
   - Use of PyTorch Lightning to abstract model training and evaluation.  

3. **Training and Validation**:  
   - Implementation of training loops and validation steps using PyTorch Lightning's `Trainer`.  
   - Configuration of optimizers, learning rate schedulers, and callbacks.  

4. **Evaluation**:  
   - Model performance analysis using metrics and visualizations.  
   - Comparison of training and validation results to assess overfitting or underfitting.  

5. **Experimentation**:  
   - Modifications to hyperparameters, architectures, and training configurations to observe their impact on performance.
